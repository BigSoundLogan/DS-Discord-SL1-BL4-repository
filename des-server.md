### Banned Criteria

- Any kind of help via summoning players or NPCs is not acceptable. This is the case for Biorr of the Twin Fangs vs the Penetrator.

- Unless required by the criteria for a run, it is not allowed to obtain items before it is usually possible. For example, giving yourself a boss weapon as soon as you start a normal SL1 run is unacceptable and will result in a disqualification.
   - Exceptions: 
     - Ask the server mods for discussion and/or permission if there is the possibility of such.
     - Normally it is acceptable to cheat in to give yourself items required for a Legend run. For example, giving yourself a broken weapon as soon as you start the game to complete a broken weapon-only run.

- Cheating and cheesing during gameplay is strictly not allowed. Turning on iframes, kills outside the bosses' arenas, messing with the stats, breaking the AI so it becomes unable to harm you... Any of this, or anything similar, will result in a disqualification. Please ask if you are uncertain about what is allowed and what isn't.

## DeS - SL1 Slayer Requirements

**You need to beat all boss fights then show proof.**

You have **two** choices in order to show proof:

* Record a video of you showing your character stats and all boss souls/bonfires/empty archstones. This will prove you defeated each of them.

* Make a gallery of **full** screenshots (no cropping or editing will be allowed) of your character stats, all boss souls, and bonfires/empty archstones. This will prove you defeated each of them.

_If you used any boss souls for items, show them as well for proof. It is strongly recommended to not use boss souls just for souls, as you are effectively destroying your own SL1 proof._

### DeS - SL1 Monumental Requirements

> SL1 Monumentals are runs with one or more handicaps to make it harder. See below for a list of what counts, and what may not. If you have any doubt, ask the server mods.

To prove and verify this challenge, you need to beat and record/stream all boss fights no matter what. It is also recommended to start recordings before you enter the boss fog. A recording where the fight is ongoing will not be accepted, and consequently disqualified.

If you are streaming or recording an entire run (start to finish), please provide timestamps as the mods are expecting to check boss kills. Not taking the time to do so will cause the verification to have a longer wait.

|* _Unless you are going for a run with the typical 'Any%' rule set. This is only applicable to speedrunning._

## Acceptable SL1 Monumental Criteria

- SL1 NG+5
- SL1 No Rolling/Blocking/Parrying
- SL1 +0 Weapons, Normal Upgrade Path, No Bleed, No Toxic, No Poison
- SL1 Fist only
- SL1 Broken Weapon
- SL1 Blindfolded
  - Not allowed to see the screen, you need a clear webcam stream to prove. 
- SL1 Deathless
  - Record the full run. 
  - Ignore dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God. 
- SL1 No Hit
  - Record the full run. 
  - Ignore dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God.


## SL1 Monumental Banned Equipment and Strategies

* Morion Blade. It's too strong. Allowed on NG+5.
* Clever Rat Ring on base NG. It's too strong.
* Second Chance. It's cheap, granting a second opportunity in the middle of a fight.
* Biorr of the Twin Fangs against Penetrator. Just don't unlock his cell in 1-2.
* Thief Ring and/or Cloak against any boss.
* Offensive spells/miracles (which you can hardly cast). 
* Multiple cheese tactics or exploits exclusive to this game. In example, using the bow glitch for Maneaters (shooting through the fog) or killing Vanguard (4-1) out of his aggro range.

### DeS Speediest Slayer

You can obtain a special role if you are the fastest player in the server to complete a SL1 or BL4 run in any of the games -all bosses-. However, if someone beats your time, you will lose the role.
