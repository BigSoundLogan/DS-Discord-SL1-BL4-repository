#### A comprehensive and community-supported repository on how the Demon's Souls Discord server manages SL1 runs and their numerous challenge variations. Maintained by Sen#1775.

[Demon's Souls Discord Server.](https://discordapp.com/invite/cCSgv4M)

### Banned Criteria

- Any kind of help via summoning players or NPCs is not acceptable. The run will be disqualified because of this. **This is the case for Biorr of the Twin Fangs' help against the Penetrator.**

- Unless required by the criteria for a run, it is not allowed to obtain items before it is usually possible. For example, giving yourself a boss weapon as soon as you start a normal SL1 run is unacceptable and will result in a disqualification.
   - Exceptions: 
     - Ask the moderators for discussion and/or permission if there is the possibility of such.

- Cheating and cheesing during gameplay is strictly not allowed. Turning on iframes, kills outside the bosses' arenas, messing with the stats, breaking the AI so it becomes unable to harm you... Any of this, or anything similar, will result in a disqualification. Please ask if you are uncertain about what is allowed and what isn't.

### Proof for SL1 Slayer of Demons

**You need to beat all boss fights then show proof.**

You have **two** choices in order to show proof:

* Record a video of you showing your character stats and all boss souls/bonfires/empty arenas. This will prove you defeated each of them.

* Make a gallery of **full** screenshots (no cropping or editing will be allowed) of your character stats, all boss souls, and bonfires/empty arenas. This will prove you defeated each of them.

_If you used any boss souls for items, show them as well for proof. It is strongly recommended to not use boss souls just for souls, as you are effectively destroying your own SL1 proof._


### Proof for SL1 Monumental of Demon's Souls

> Monumental runs are SL1 runs with one or more handicaps to make it harder. Check the list below for possibilities of what counts, and what doesn't. If you have any doubt, ask the server mods.

To prove and verify this challenge, you need to beat and record/stream all boss fights no matter what. It is also recommended to start recordings before you enter the boss fog. A recording where the fight is ongoing and the boss has lost significant health or has advanced through phases will not be accepted, and consequently disqualified.

If you are streaming or recording an entire run (start to finish), please provide timestamps as the moderators will be expecting to check boss kills. Not taking the time to do so will just cause the verification to take a longer wait.

## Acceptable SL1 Monumental Criteria

- SL1 NG+5
- SL1 +0 Weapons, Normal Upgrade Path, No Bleed, No Poison, No Plague
- SL1 Fist only
- SL1 Broken Weapon
- SL1 No Roll/Block/Parry/Sprint
  - Sprint is not mandatory for this run, it is simply optional. If you are including this handicap, read the *Banned Equipment and Strategies* section for more information.
- SL1 Blindfolded
  - Not allowed to see the screen, you need a clear webcam stream to prove. 
- SL1 Deathless
  - Record the full run. 
  - Ignore dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God. 
- SL1 No Hit
  - Record the full run. 
  - Ignore dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God.
  
  ## SL1 Monumental Banned Equipment and Strategies

* Morion Blade. It's too strong. Allowed on NG+5.
* Clever Rat Ring. It's too strong. Allowed on NG+5.
* Second Chance. It's cheap, granting a second opportunity in the middle of a fight.
* Thief's Ring and/or Cloak against any boss.
* Offensive spells/miracles (which you can hardly cast). 
* Multiple cheese tactics or exploits exclusive to this game. In example, using the bow glitch for Maneaters (shooting through the fog) or killing Vanguard (4-1) out of his aggro range.
* In the case you are doing a run that includes **No Sprint**:
   - It is allowed to use Thief's Ring for Old Hero, Armoured Spider and Flamelurker.
   - Offensive magic is allowed on the second pillar of the Dragon God's fight.


### Speediest Roles

You can obtain a special role if you are the fastest player in the server to complete a SL1 run. However, if someone beats your time, you will lose the role.
