#### A comprehensive and community-supported repository on how the Demon's Souls Discord server manages SL1 runs and their numerous challenge variations. Maintained by Sen#1775.

[Demon's Souls Discord Server.](https://discordapp.com/invite/cCSgv4M)

### Banned Criteria

- **Every boss must be killed.** A boss can be defined by the sight of a health bar and/or a fog gate (regardless of the need to enter through such). The bosses are: Vanguard*, Phalanx, Tower Knight, Penetrator, False King Allant, Armor Spider, Flamelurker, Dragon God, Fool's Idol, Maneaters, Old Monk, Adjudicator, Old Hero, Storm King, Leechmonger, Dirty Colossus, Maiden Astraea, True King Allant.

   - Vanguard falls under different specifications depending on which run you are attempting. Make sure to **fully** read the section you're interested in.
   
- Multiple cheese tactics or exploits exclusive to this game. In example, using the bow glitch for Maneaters (shooting through the fog) or killing Vanguard (4-1) out of his aggro range.
   
   - In terms of glitches, it is allowed to dupe as it simply cuts down farming time. Remake specific glitches like the infamous coin level up glitch is obviously not allowed.

- Any kind of help via summoning players or NPCs is not acceptable. Every run found breaching this will be disqualified. **This is the case for Biorr of the Twin Fangs' help against the Penetrator.**

- Unless required by the specifications of a run, it is not allowed to obtain items before it is usually possible. For example, using external tools/debug to give yourself a weapon as soon as you start in the Nexus is unacceptable and will result in a disqualification.
   - Exceptions: 
     - Ask the moderators for discussion and/or permission if there is the possibility of such.

- Cheating and cheesing during gameplay is strictly not allowed. Turning on iframes, kills outside the bosses' arenas, messing with the stats, breaking the AI so it kills any challenge... Any of this, or anything similar, will result in a disqualification. Please ask if you are uncertain about what is allowed and what isn't.

### Proof for SL1 Slayer of Demons

**You need to beat all boss fights then show proof.**

You have **two** choices in order to show proof for a **SL1 Slayer of Demons** run:

* Record a video showing your character stats and all boss souls, archstones or empty arenas. This will prove you defeated each of them.

* Make a gallery of **full** screenshots (no cropping or editing will be allowed) of your character stats and all boss souls, archstones or empty arenas. This will prove you defeated each of them.

**Vanguard:** For a SL1 **Slayer of Demons** run, you are allowed to kill Vanguard either in the tutorial or in 4-1.

_If you used any boss souls for items, show them as well for proof. It is strongly recommended to not use boss souls just for souls, as you are effectively destroying your own SL1 proof._

_For example, if you use Storm King's soul for Morion Blade, you will need to give Flamelurker's soul to Blacksmith Ed. In this case, alongside the rest of your proof must come showcasing Morion Blade, and Flamelurker and Storm King's arenas/archstones._


### Proof for SL1 Monumental of Demon's Souls

> Monumental runs are SL1 runs with various specifications that make them exceptionally harder. Check the list below for possibilities of what counts, and what doesn't. If you have any doubt, ask moderators.

To prove and verify this challenge, you need to beat and record/stream all boss fights no matter what. It is also obligatory to start recordings before you enter the boss fog. A recording where the fight is ongoing and the boss has lost significant health or has advanced through phases will not be accepted, and consequently disqualified.

If you are streaming or recording an entire run (start to finish), please provide timestamps as the moderators will usually be expecting to check boss kills. Not taking the time to do so will just cause the verification to take longer.

**Vanguard:** For a SL1 **Monumental** run, it is recommended to kill Vanguard on the tutorial due to it being treated as a proper boss fight, offering the highest level of control for the runner. However, kills in 4-1 are allowed. In any case, **both recordings must start before engaging Vanguard.**

## Acceptable SL1 Monumental Criteria

- SL1 NG+5
- SL1 +0 Weapons, Normal Upgrade Path, No Bleed, No Poison, No Plague
- SL1 Broken Weapon
- SL1 No Roll/Block/Parry/Sprint
  - Sprint is not mandatory for this run, it is simply optional. If you are including this handicap, read the *Banned Equipment and Strategies* section for more information.
- SL1 Deathless
  - Record the full run. 
  - Ignores dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God. 
- SL1 No Hit
  - Record the full run. 
  - Ignores dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God.
  - Ignores fall damage.
  
  ## SL1 Monumental Banned Equipment and Strategies

* Morion Blade on regular NG. It's too strong. Allowed on NG+5.
* Clever Rat Ring on regular NG. It's too strong. Allowed on NG+5.
* Second Chance. It's cheap, granting a second opportunity in the middle of a fight.
* Thief's Ring and/or Cloak against any boss. As a fact, concealment has the chance of breaking the AI. Whether it is allowed for specific runs or not is up to a case-by-case basis and pertinent discussion.
* Offensive spells/miracles.
* Defensive spells such as:
   - Protection, which trivializes challenges with a 30% defense increase.
   - Warding, which cheaply trivializes challenges with a 70% defense increase.
   - Water veil, which cheaply trivializes fire-based challenges with a 45% defense increase.

* In the case you are doing a run that includes **No Sprint**:
   - Offensive magic is allowed on the second pillar of the Dragon God's fight. It is pretty much impossible to get past without sprinting.
   - It is allowed to use Thief's Ring for Old Hero, Armor Spider. 
   - It is specifically not allowed to use Thief's Ring on Tower Knight.
  
### Speediest Monumental

You can obtain a special role if you are the fastest player in the server to complete a SL1 run. However, if someone beats your time, you will lose the role.

- Time of completion will be dictated by RTA (Real-Time Attack). Experimentation has found IGT (Ingame Time) to be inconsistent, hard to verify, and forces runners to be on the Private Server in order to provide a full HH:MM:SS time.
   - Due to this, it is recommended to use a split tool, and provide [on-screen timer](https://i.imgur.com/SqvZ3Ij.png) during the run.

- A speedrun will start on the tutorial. **Vanguard is mandatory.** **Death by tutorial Dragon God is mandatory.** **No skips allowed, no glitches.**

- **Emulation, PS3 and PS5:** RPCS3 and PS3 will be categorized differently due to FPS and hardware differences and obviously, the Remake will be its own category.
